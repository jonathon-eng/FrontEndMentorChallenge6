# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



The challenge itself wasn't so bad, considering that I've attempted a harder challenge already, so this was just reusing some of those skills.

### What I learned

Since I've already had experience from other challenges, I just attempted this without trying to search for advice. That was my intention, but I did have to search a little.



### Continued development

Possibly can reuse this more in the future.
